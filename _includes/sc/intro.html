  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This Technical Stream workshop will include modules on
  automating tasks using Unix shell, version control using
  Git, and reproducible research using the open source
  programming langauge Python. Participants will be 
  encouraged to help one another and to apply what they 
  have learned to their own research problems.
